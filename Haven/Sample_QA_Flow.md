\# Haven — Sample Q\&A Flow (5+ Exchanges)



\## Exchange 1

User: I feel stressed.

Bot: I’m really sorry you’re feeling that way. Want to tell me what’s been causing the stress recently?



\## Exchange 2

User: College and family issues.

Bot: That’s a lot to carry at the same time. If you had to name the biggest pressure right now — college or family — which one feels heavier?



\## Exchange 3

User: Family.

Bot: I understand. Family pressure can feel personal and constant. Do you want to talk about what happened, or do you want help calming your mind first?



\## Exchange 4

User: Help me calm down.

Bot: Okay. Let’s do a simple grounding exercise. Take a slow breath in for 4 seconds, hold for 2, exhale for 6. Repeat 3 times. Tell me if your body feels even 5% calmer.



\## Exchange 5

User: Slightly calmer.

Bot: That’s progress, and it matters. Now let’s take it gently — what’s one thought that keeps repeating in your head right now?



\## Exchange 6

User: That I’ll never get out of this.

Bot: That’s a scary thought to live with. But thoughts aren’t permanent truths — they’re signals. You’re already moving forward by talking about it.
