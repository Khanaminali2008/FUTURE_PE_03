\# Documentation — Prompt Strategy \& Tone Control (Task 3)



\## Goal

To build 3 distinct chatbots that are not generic, with:

\- unique voice

\- controlled tone

\- realistic conversation flow

\- consistent behavior

\- useful knowledge bases



---



\## Prompt Design Approach

Each chatbot was built using:

1\. \*\*Persona Prompt\*\*

&nbsp;  - Role definition

&nbsp;  - Communication style

&nbsp;  - Do’s and Don’ts

&nbsp;  - Boundaries and limitations

2\. \*\*Conversation Structure\*\*

&nbsp;  - Welcome message

&nbsp;  - common user intents

&nbsp;  - safe fallback responses

3\. \*\*Knowledge Base\*\*

&nbsp;  - FAQ-style Q\&A entries

&nbsp;  - platform-friendly formatting (Noupe-ready)

4\. \*\*Tone Control\*\*

&nbsp;  - Short, structured responses

&nbsp;  - consistent emotional tone

&nbsp;  - clear safety boundaries (especially for Haven)



---



\## Reasoning

Prompt engineering is not just writing a single prompt.  

This task required designing systems that keep AI responses consistent across different user messages.



---



\## Result

3 chatbot personas built for real-world use cases:

\- emotional support

\- productivity coaching

\- travel planning
